Edit the FIRST image (lifestyle scene) to naturally include the product shown in the SECOND image.
This is a {product_brand} {product_name}.
Place the product {placement_hint}.
IMPORTANT:
- Use the EXACT product from the second image - match its shape, color, details, and branding precisely
- Integrate it seamlessly into the first image's lighting, shadows, and atmosphere
- The product should look like it was photographed in the scene, not composited
- Maintain the original scene's style and composition
