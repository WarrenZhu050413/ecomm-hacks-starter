### What We Built

**Reverie** is an advertising platform that integrates shoppable products into Pinterest-style lifestyle imagery. Instead of interrupting the user's social media experience with separate ad placements, Reverie uses AI to naturally place products into scenes the user is already drawn to, allowing organic product discovery through hover-to-reveal interactions.

### How It Works

1. **AI-Powered Product Placement**: Using Nano Banana Pro, we composite products into curated lifestyle scenes. Nano Banana blends the product into the environment with proper lighting, shadows, and perspective.

2. **Mask-Based Hover Detection**: Nano Banana also generates a segmentation mask that identifies exactly where the product is in the scene. We use red-channel extraction to create a clean binary mask (white for product, black for background).

3. **Natural Product Discovery**: When users hover over a product area (detected with canvas pixel sampling of the mask), a subtle highlight appears and a translucent product card slides in. Users can add the product to their bag or complete a 1-click purchase.

4. **Non-Intrusive UX**: The focus of the UX is that ads don't interrupt the consumption experience, instead being placed in locations that match their aesthetic preferences and incite curiosity.

### Key Features

- **Product insertion into images** - Organic insertions of products into images
- **Gallery scrolling** - Pinterest-style scroll with staggered card layouts
- **Mask-based hover detection** - Detects when user hovers or clicks on the product, showing translucent popup with the purchasing options
- **Writing pane** - Users can describe their mood/vibe to interact with and personalize the feed
- **'Add to Bag' animation** - When added to the user's bag, the product physically fades out from the scene

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + TipTap (rich text editor)
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Python + uvicorn
- **Models:** Nano Banana Pro for scene generation and mask creation, Gemini 3 Pro for text
- **Styling:** CSS, Playfair Display + Crimson Pro + DM Sans typography
- **Image Processing:** Pillow for mask post-processing (red-channel extraction)

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/WarrenZhu050413/ecomm-hacks-starter.git
cd ecomm-hacks-starter

# Frontend setup
npm install
npm run dev

# Backend setup (in separate terminal)
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Add your GEMINI_API_KEY to .env
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Generate test images (optional)
cd backend
uv run python test_product_integration.py
```

### Screenshots

*Consumer Gallery View*
- Pinterest-style scrolling gallery with AI-generated lifestyle scenes
- Products naturally integrated into each image
- Hover detection highlights only the product area

*Product Hover Interaction*
- Subtle white highlight on product
- Glassmorphic product card appears to the right
- Brand, name, price, and Buy Now button

*Mask Generation Pipeline*
- Original product + Background scene → Nano Banana → Integrated scene + Product mask

### Challenges We Faced

- **Visual interfaces under time pressure**: Attention to detail within user interactions and aesthetics of pages
- **Coordinate mapping**: CSS `object-fit: cover` crops images differently than the masks, requiring hover detection to consider offset.

### What's Next

- **Social network layer**: Build a Pinterest-like platform where users create and share mood boards, with every image potentially shoppable—network effects driving social commerce.
- **Personalized feeds**: Use writing pane input and browsing behavior to curate images matching each user's aesthetic.
